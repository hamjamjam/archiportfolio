I am a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Architecture. I have lived on three different continents and I believe that my unique background will add a lot to the Work Club network. I love working together and learning from my peers; I have a lot to bring to the table in terms of technical knowledge and design experience.

I am currently working on applying technology to specific sports:
For many water sports, namely rowing, stand up paddleboard and canoeing, the only way to track on water workouts is with the use of extremely expensive and relatively basic hardware. At VS Rowteck, we aim to make use of your smartphone's GPS and accelerometer to create an app that will allow users to log their speed, distance travelled, strokes per minute and so many more sport specific metrics.

Furthermore, the logged workout information will be extremely easy to share with teammates, coaches and friends.

We believe that the project is scalable because we can apply the technology to land training sessions (workouts in the gym) which will open the application to a far wider audience. We believe that through high quality technology we can make working out a more social activity and give people the opportunity to more effectively track their progress.

I would love to join the Work Club community, please let me know what you think.
